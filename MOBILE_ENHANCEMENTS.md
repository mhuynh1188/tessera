## 🚀 **Recommended Next Steps**

### **Priority 1: Workspace Mobile Support**
```typescript
// Add to GameifiedWorkspaceBoard.tsx
const handleTouchStart = (e: TouchEvent) => {
  if (e.touches.length === 2) {
    // Handle pinch-to-zoom
    setIsPinching(true);
    setInitialPinchDistance(getTouchDistance(e.touches));
  }
};

const handlePinchZoom = (e: TouchEvent) => {
  if (e.touches.length === 2 && isPinching) {
    const currentDistance = getTouchDistance(e.touches);
    const scaleChange = currentDistance / initialPinchDistance;
    setCanvasTransform(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      scale: Math.min(Math.max(prev.scale * scaleChange, 0.1), 3)
    }));
  }
};
```

### **Priority 2: Mobile Navigation**
- Implement bottom sheet for mobile drawing tools
- Add mobile-optimized modal layouts
- Implement swipe navigation for tabs

### **Priority 3: PWA Features**
- Add service worker for offline functionality
- Implement app installation prompts
- Add push notifications for collaboration

## 🧪 **Testing Recommendations**

### **Device Testing**
