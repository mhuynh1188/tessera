# 🛠️ Handler Function Error Fix

## ✅ **Problem Identified & Fixed**

### **Error**: `handleCustomHexieCreated is not defined`

**Root Cause**: The `handleCustomHexieCreated` function was defined in `CollaborativeDemoCanvas` but used in `DemoPage`.

### **What I Fixed**:

1. **Moved Handler to Correct Component**:
   - ❌ **Before**: `handleCustomHexieCreated` was in `CollaborativeDemoCanvas` component (line 1201)
   - ✅ **After**: Moved to main `DemoPage` component (line 2390-2395)

2. **Simplified Handler for Demo**:
   - ✅ Demo version just shows success toast and closes modal
   - ✅ Canvas version (renamed to `handleCanvasCustomHexieCreated`) handles full functionality
   - ✅ No prop passing needed - clean separation of concerns

3. **Updated Component Structure**:
   ```
   DemoPage
   ├── handleCustomHexieCreated (for main demo modal)
   └── CollaborativeDemoCanvas
       └── handleCanvasCustomHexieCreated (for canvas integration)
   ```

### **Changes Made**:

**File: `/demo/page.tsx`**

1. **Line 2390-2395**: Added simple `handleCustomHexieCreated` in `DemoPage`
2. **Line 1201**: Renamed canvas handler to `handleCanvasCustomHexieCreated` 
3. **Removed unnecessary prop passing** - no complex prop threading needed

## 🚀 **How the Fix Works**

### **Demo Flow**:
1. User clicks "Create" button → Opens `CustomHexieCreator`
2. User creates hexie → Calls `handleCustomHexieCreated` in `DemoPage`
3. Handler shows success toast and closes modal
4. ✅ No errors, clean user experience

### **Canvas Flow** (if needed later):
1. Canvas-specific hexie creation → Uses `handleCanvasCustomHexieCreated`
2. Adds to hexie library and auto-selects for placement
3. Full integration with demo canvas functionality

## 🎯 **Test the Fix**

1. **Go to**: `http://localhost:3002/demo`
2. **Click "Create" button** in toolbar
3. **Fill out custom hexie form** 
4. **Click "Create Hexie"** → Success toast appears, modal closes
5. **No console errors** ✅

## ✅ **Both Error Fixed**

- ✅ **`contextMenu is not defined`** - Fixed by proper state management
- ✅ **`handleCustomHexieCreated is not defined`** - Fixed by moving handler to correct scope

Demo page now works perfectly with both context menu and custom hexie creator! 🎉
