## üß† **Psychological Design Philosophy**

The system follows **Jordan Peterson's competence hierarchy** principles:

- **Safety-First**: Graduated exposure to complexity based on user readiness
- **Strengths-Based**: Focus on developing existing capabilities rather than fixing deficits
- **Meaningful Progression**: Real-world skill development tied to gamification
- **Collaborative**: Non-competitive mechanics that encourage mutual support
- **Anonymous Options**: Privacy protection for sensitive workplace discussions

## üìä **Database Integration**

The system uses these new tables (already created via the SQL script):
- `antipattern_types` - Severity and psychological framework data
- `workspace_boards` - Session management and game settings
- `hexie_annotations` - Text annotations with privacy controls
- `user_competencies` - Role progression and skill tracking
- `game_sessions` - Progress and safety monitoring
- `hexie_combinations` - Novel intervention creation
- `safety_monitoring` - Real-time psychological safety alerts
- `support_resources` - Therapeutic intervention resources
